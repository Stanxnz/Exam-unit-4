step 1
Used previous assignments to ensure propper html 5 scaffold and references.

step 2
did not understand the task, but after figuring out what to do it was pretty straiht forward.

step 3
very similar to previous tasks so I could use that experience again.

step 4
this was new, but the mozilla link helped out a lot.

step 5
tried to recreate the example 1:1 and then personalised it a bit soo it did not look too boring.

step 6
need to change a lot on my previous code for this one.
