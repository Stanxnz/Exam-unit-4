step 1
Used previous assignments to ensure propper html 5 scaffold and references.

step 2
did not understand the task, but after figuring out what to do it was pretty straiht forward.

step 3
very similar to previous tasks so I could use that experience again.

step 4
this was new, but the mozilla link helped out a lot.

step 5
tried to recreate the example 1:1 and then personalised it a bit soo it did not look too boring.

step 6
need to change a lot on my previous code for this one. Worked on it for quite some time, though it was done but now my browser only shows choose file option, so it just removed everything I made so far... It was a spelling mistake between my html file and my mjs file, they did not match so it could not read it correctly. Luckily this is a simple fix instead of having to rewrite it all.

step 7 
Task seemd pretty straighforward and I thought I nailed it pretty fast too. But when I ran the code in the live server I saw that the saved games where not showcased anymore. I fixed this by adding a const that ensured the correct addgame id was getting used when it needed to, which worked as expected.

step 8
well I thought this was task seven haha, but yea made a function that was needed to make the new html code work together with my actual mjs code.

step 9
again very similar to the task we had previously, need to implement code so I can delete games. Used similar code aswell, also used the same icon as the delete button as a little extra.

step 10
